Our main feature is the category of that venue. After this stage, the column \"Venue's Category\" wil be One-hot encoded and different venues will have different feature-columns. After On-hot encoding we will integrate all restaurant columns to one column \"Total Restaurants\" and all food joint columns to \"Total Joints\" column. We assumed that different resaturants use the Same raw groceries. This assumption is made for simplicity and due to not having a very detailed dataset about different venues."
